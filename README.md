# Description

The following repository contains code for the distributed Spanning Tree Protocol used by bridges to determine a spanning tree, given a topology comprised of LAN segments and Bridges.

This assignment was done as part of the course **CS224: Computer Networks** at IIT Bombay.

# Directory Structure

* *bridge.py*: Class definitions for LAN segment, Bridge and message transfer
* *bridgesim.py*: Accept .txt file as input and output the spanning tree, followed by the forwarding table for each bridge after each message transfer
* *format.docx*: States the expected input/output format and a few examples
